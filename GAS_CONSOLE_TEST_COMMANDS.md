# 🧪 Google Apps Script Console Test Commands

## Copy-Paste Commands for Verification

The BaseService fix has been deployed successfully! Run these commands one by one in the Google Apps Script console to verify everything works.

### 🎯 Test 1: Original Error Resolution

```javascript
// Test the specific error that was failing
testOriginalError();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Original Error Reproduction Test ===
✅ SUCCESS: Original error resolved!
   - DatabaseService instantiated successfully
   - BaseService inheritance confirmed
   - No "BaseService is not defined" error
```

---

### 🔍 Test 2: Complete Service Validation

```javascript
// Run comprehensive service tests
testBaseServiceResolution();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== BaseService Resolution Test ===
✓ Test 1 PASSED: BaseService is defined
✓ Test 2 PASSED: BaseService instantiation successful  
✓ Test 3 PASSED: DatabaseService inherits from BaseService
✓ Test 4 PASSED: getGlobalDB() returns proper DatabaseService instance

=== Test Summary ===
Total Tests: 4
Passed: 4
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! BaseService resolution is working correctly.
```

---

### 💊 Test 3: System Health Check

```javascript
// Check overall system health
performServiceHealthCheck();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Service Health Check ===
Overall health: healthy (3/3 services healthy)
```

---

### ⚙️ Test 4: Service Initialization

```javascript
// Verify service initialization system
initializeServices();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Anwar Sales Ecosystem Service Initialization ===
Phase 1: Core dependency validation...
✓ BaseService loaded successfully
✓ Config loaded successfully
✓ Logger loaded successfully

Phase 2: Service dependency initialization...
✓ DatabaseService class available
✓ DatabaseService instantiation successful

=== Initialization Complete ===
Services: 6/7 successful
Errors: 0
🎉 All critical services initialized successfully!
```

---

### 🚨 Test 5: Manual Database Service Test

```javascript
// Test the exact line that was failing
try {
  const db = new DatabaseService(true);
  console.log("✅ SUCCESS: DatabaseService created without BaseService error!");
  console.log("Database service type:", typeof db);
  console.log("Is instance of BaseService:", db instanceof BaseService);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("❌ FAILED:", error.message);
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: DatabaseService created without BaseService error!
Database service type: object
Is instance of BaseService: true
```

---

### 🔄 Test 6: Global DB Function

```javascript
// Test the global database function
try {
  const globalDb = getGlobalDB();
  console.log("✅ SUCCESS: getGlobalDB() works correctly!");
  console.log("Global DB type:", typeof globalDb);
  console.log("Is DatabaseService:", globalDb instanceof DatabaseService);
  console.log("Is BaseService:", globalDb instanceof BaseService);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("❌ FAILED:", error.message);
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: getGlobalDB() works correctly!
Global DB type: object
Is DatabaseService: true
Is BaseService: true
```

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

If all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ **No "BaseService is not defined" errors**
- ✅ **All services instantiate correctly**  
- ✅ **Inheritance chains work properly**
- ✅ **100% test success rate**
- ✅ **System initializes without issues**

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Diagnostic Commands:

```javascript
// Check what services are available
console.log("BaseService available:", typeof BaseService !== 'undefined');
console.log("DatabaseService available:", typeof DatabaseService !== 'undefined');
console.log("getGlobalDB available:", typeof getGlobalDB === 'function');

// Emergency service recovery
emergencyServiceRecovery();

// Service loading diagnostic
diagnosticServiceLoadingOrder();
```

### Common Issues:

1. **"BaseService is not defined"** - Run `initializeServices()` manually
2. **Services not inheriting** - Check if files loaded in correct order
3. **Functions not available** - Refresh the Apps Script editor and try again

---

## 📊 What Each Test Validates

- **testOriginalError()**: Reproduces and confirms the original error is fixed
- **testBaseServiceResolution()**: Comprehensive validation of all service loading
- **performServiceHealthCheck()**: System health and service status 
- **initializeServices()**: Service loading order and initialization
- **Manual tests**: Direct verification of specific functionality
