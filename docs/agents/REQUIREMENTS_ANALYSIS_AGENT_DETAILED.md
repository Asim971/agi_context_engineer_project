Task: Analyze the provided business requirements and generate:
1. Structured functional requirements
2. Non-functional requirements with measurable criteria
3. Integration requirements and dependencies
4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
5. Success criteria and acceptance criteria

## Integration with Agent OS Guidelines

All requirements analysis, validation, and documentation must incorporate and adhere to the guidelines outlined in the following Agent OS configuration files:

- `ai-guidelines.md`: Provides best practices for AI agent behavior, prompt engineering, and integration standards.
- `mission.md`: Outlines the overall mission and objectives of the Anwar Sales Management System.
- `sales-eco-spec.md`: Details the specific requirements and specifications for the sales ecosystem.
- `code-standards.md`: Defines coding standards, best practices, and security guidelines for development.

These guidelines ensure that all requirements are aligned with the project's architecture, security requirements, and operational standards. Outputs must explicitly reference relevant sections from these documents to maintain consistency and compliance.

Output Format:
- Use structured markdown with clear sections
- Include traceability references
- Provide priority rankings (High/Medium/Low)
- Include feasibility assessments
