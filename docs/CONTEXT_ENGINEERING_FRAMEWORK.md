# Context Engineering Framework

## Overview

The Context Engineering Framework defines how context is captured, managed, shared, and utilized across all AI agents in the Anwar Sales Management System's agentic vibe coding workflow. <mcreference link="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-design-context-aware-systems-skills-systems-design" index="3">3</mcreference> This framework ensures that all agents have access to relevant, accurate, and up-to-date context information for optimal decision-making and collaboration.
