# Risk Assessment Framework - Anwar Sales Management System

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the Anwar Sales Management System, identifying potential technical, business, operational, and security risks along with their mitigation strategies. This assessment is based on the current system architecture and planned enhancements.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Scoring Matrix

**Probability Scale:**

- Low (1): 0-25% chance of occurrence
- Medium (2): 26-50% chance of occurrence
- High (3): 51-75% chance of occurrence
- Very High (4): 76-100% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**

- Low (1): Minor disruption, minimal business impact
- Medium (2): Moderate disruption, some business impact
- High (3): Significant disruption, major business impact
- Critical (4): Severe disruption, critical business impact

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**

**Risk Priority:**

- Low Risk: 1-4
- Medium Risk: 5-8
- High Risk: 9-12
- Critical Risk: 13-16
