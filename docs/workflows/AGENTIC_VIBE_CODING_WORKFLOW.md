# Agentic Vibe Coding Workflow Framework

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive agentic vibe coding workflow designed specifically for the Anwar Sales Management System, integrating context engineering principles with AI-driven development processes from requirement analysis to deployment.

## What is Agentic Vibe Coding?

Agentic Vibe Coding combines:

- **Vibe Coding**: Human-in-the-loop, creative, rapid feedback development approach
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous AI agents that make decisions, take actions, and coordinate tasks
- **Context Engineering**: Systematic approach to managing information flow and context across AI interactions

## Core Principles

### 1. Context-First Development

- All AI agents operate with rich, structured context
- Context includes stakeholder information, business rules, technical constraints, and project history
- Dynamic context updates based on project evolution

### 2. Human-AI Collaboration

- AI agents handle repetitive, analytical, and optimization tasks
- Humans focus on creative decisions, strategic planning, and quality validation
- Continuous feedback loops between human developers and AI agents

### 3. Autonomous Decision Making

- AI agents can make informed decisions within defined boundaries
- Escalation protocols for complex or high-risk decisions
- Learning from previous decisions to improve future performance

### 4. Iterative Refinement

- Continuous improvement of both code and AI agent performance
- Regular evaluation and optimization of workflows
- Adaptive processes based on project needs and team feedback
