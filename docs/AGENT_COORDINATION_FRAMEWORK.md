## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Sequential Coordination

**Pattern**: Linear dependency chain where agents execute in sequence
**Use Case**: Phase transitions and dependent deliverables

```
Requirements Analysis → Architecture Design → Database Design → API Design
                                    ↓                              ↓
                               UI Design ←─────────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
Frontend Development ← Backend Development ← Security Integration
                                    ↓
Testing → Deployment → Monitoring
```

### 2. Parallel Coordination

**Pattern**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on independent tasks
**Use Case**: Development phase where frontend and backend can be developed concurrently

```
Architecture Design
        ↓
    ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
    │ Database│   API   │Security │UI Design│
    │ Design  │ Design  │ Review  │         │
    └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
            ↓
    ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
    │  Frontend   │  Backend    │
    │ Development │Development  │
    └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### 3. Collaborative Coordination

**Pattern**: Multiple agents working together on shared deliverables
**Use Case**: Complex tasks requiring multiple expertise areas

```
API Design Agent ←→ Security Agent ←→ Backend Development Agent
        ↓                ↓                    ↓
    API Specs    Security Controls    Implementation
        ↑                                    ↑
UI Designer Agent ←→ Frontend Development Agent
        ↓                    ↓
   UI Designs         UI Implementation
```

### 4. Feedback Coordination

**Pattern**: Iterative feedback loops between agents
**Use Case**: Quality assurance and continuous improvement

```
Development Agent → Testing Agent → Feedback → Development Agent
                         ↓
                  Monitoring Agent
                         ↓
                  Performance Feedback
```
