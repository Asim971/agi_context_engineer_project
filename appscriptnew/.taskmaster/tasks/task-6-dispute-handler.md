# Task 6: Implement DisputeHandler.js - Critical Gap Resolution

## Overview
Create a comprehensive dispute resolution workflow handler that manages dispute submissions, routing to appropriate stakeholders (CRO/BDO), status tracking, and resolution processes. This addresses a critical gap identified in the journey analysis audit where dispute resolution workflows are documented but not implemented.

## Priority: High
**Assigned to:** Senior Developer

## Implementation Requirements

### Architecture Guidelines
- Handler must extend BaseService and follow existing architecture patterns
- Integrate with existing CRM and notification systems (WhatsApp, email)
- Implement proper error handling using AppScriptError framework
- Include comprehensive logging for audit trail and debugging
- Follow service locator pattern for dependency injection

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Dispute Workflow State Machine
**States:**
- `submitted` - Initial dispute submission
- `assigned` - Assigned to stakeholder (CRO/BDO)
- `in-review` - Under investigation
- `resolved` - Resolution provided
- `closed` - Dispute closed and documented

#### 2. Dispute Submission Handling
- Validate dispute data and required fields
- Generate unique dispute ID using IdService
- Store dispute information in database
- Trigger initial notifications

#### 3. Stakeholder Routing Logic
- Route disputes to CRO or BDO based on dispute type
- Consider workload balancing
- Escalation rules for unassigned disputes

#### 4. Status Tracking and Updates
- Real-time status updates
- Audit trail of all status changes
- Notification triggers for status transitions

#### 5. Notification Integration
- WhatsApp notifications for stakeholders
- Email notifications for status updates
- SMS alerts for urgent disputes

#### 6. Resolution Documentation
- Capture resolution details and actions taken
- Document closure reasons and outcomes
- Generate resolution reports

## Technical Specifications

### File Location
`src/handlers/DisputeHandler.js`

### Dependencies
- BaseService (extends)
- CRMHandler (integration)
- WhatsAppService (notifications)
- DatabaseService (data persistence)
- LoggerService (audit logging)
- ValidationService (data validation)

### Key Methods
```javascript
// Core dispute management
submitDispute(disputeData)
assignDispute(disputeId, stakeholderId)
updateDisputeStatus(disputeId, newStatus, notes)
resolveDispute(disputeId, resolution)
closeDispute(disputeId, closureReason)

// Query and reporting
getDisputeById(disputeId)
getDisputesByStatus(status)
getDisputesByStakeholder(stakeholderId)
generateDisputeReport(filters)

// Workflow management
escalateDispute(disputeId, reason)
reassignDispute(disputeId, newStakeholderId)
getDisputeHistory(disputeId)
```

### Data Model
```javascript
{
  id: "string", // Unique dispute ID
  type: "string", // Dispute category
  title: "string", // Brief description
  description: "string", // Detailed description
  submittedBy: "object", // User information
  submittedAt: "datetime",
  assignedTo: "string", // Stakeholder ID
  assignedAt: "datetime",
  status: "string", // Current status
  priority: "string", // high, medium, low
  resolution: "object", // Resolution details
  resolvedAt: "datetime",
  closedAt: "datetime",
  history: "array", // Status change history
  attachments: "array", // Supporting documents
  notifications: "array" // Notification log
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Dispute submission validation
- Status transition logic
- Stakeholder assignment rules
- Notification triggering

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end dispute workflow
- CRM system integration
- Notification system integration
- Database persistence

### Performance Tests
- High-volume dispute processing
- Concurrent status updates
- Query performance optimization

## Validation Criteria

**EM Review Points:**
1. Implementation follows documented dispute journey flows
2. All state transitions work correctly
3. Stakeholder routing logic is accurate
4. Notifications are sent appropriately
5. Audit trail is comprehensive
6. Error handling covers edge cases
7. Performance meets requirements

## Success Metrics
- 100% of dispute journey flows implemented
- < 2 second response time for status updates
- 99.9% notification delivery success rate
- Zero data loss during dispute processing
- Complete audit trail for all disputes

## Dependencies
- Task 1-5 must be completed (foundation services)
- CRMHandler.js must be available
- WhatsAppService must be functional
- DatabaseService must be operational

## Estimated Effort
**Development:** 3-4 weeks
**Testing:** 1-2 weeks
**Integration:** 1 week

## Notes
- This task addresses a critical gap identified in the journey analysis audit
- Implementation should prioritize data integrity and audit compliance
- Consider future integration with WorkflowEngine (Task 8)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems
