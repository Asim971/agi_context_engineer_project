# Journey Analysis Audit - Gap Resolution Summary

## Audit Overview
Based on the comprehensive journey analysis and implementation audit of the Anwar Sales Management System, critical gaps have been identified between documented user journeys and actual system implementation. This document summarizes the findings and the task tickets created to address these gaps.

## Current Implementation Status
