  return false;
}
```

**After (Modern Pattern):**
```javascript
// Comprehensive API integration with error handling
return this.executeWithErrorHandling(
  async () => {
    this.validateMessageInput(phone, message);
    await this.applyRateLimit();
    const response = await this.makeApiRequest(options);
    // ... processing with detailed logging
  },
  { operation: 'sendMessage', phone: this.sanitizePhoneForLogging(phone) },
  'sendMessage'
);
```

  overall: 'HEALTHY',
  components: {
    database: 'HEALTHY',
    whatsapp: 'HEALTHY',
    configuration: 'HEALTHY',
    errorHandling: 'HEALTHY',
    logging: 'HEALTHY'
  }
};
```
