# Journey Analysis and Implementation Audit Agent

## Mission
Analyze the complete user journey diagram, extract all business flows, and conduct a comprehensive audit of the current implementation to identify gaps and generate actionable issue tickets.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Journey Analysis Phase
- Parse and analyze `e:\Anwar_sales_eco\journeys\full_journey.drawio.xml`
- Extract all user flows, decision points, and process steps
- Document each actor (BDO, CRM, Dispute Board, Engineers, etc.)
- Map out complete workflow sequences
- Identify all integration points and data flows

### 2. Implementation Audit Phase
- Systematically examine `e:\Anwar_sales_eco\src` codebase
- Cross-reference journey flows with actual implementation
- Verify each handler, service, and component exists
- Check data flow integrity and business logic implementation
- Validate form handling, sheet operations, and API integrations

### 3. Gap Analysis and Issue Generation
- Identify missing implementations for each journey step
- Generate detailed issue tickets for gaps found
- Manually create tickets in `e:\Anwar_sales_eco\appscriptnew\.taskmaster\tasks`
- Prioritize issues based on business impact

{
  "id": "[AUTO_INCREMENT]",
  "title": "[SPECIFIC_ISSUE_TITLE]",
  "description": "[DETAILED_DESCRIPTION]",
  "priority": "[high|medium|low]",
  "category": "[missing_implementation|bug_fix|enhancement]",
  "affected_journey": "[JOURNEY_STEP_REFERENCE]",
  "implementation_details": "[TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS]",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "[CRITERION_1]",
    "[CRITERION_2]"
  ],
  "dependencies": "[RELATED_TASKS]",
  "estimated_effort": "[HOURS_OR_STORY_POINTS]",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

#### Issue Categories
1. **Missing Core Functionality**
   - Unimplemented journey steps
   - Missing handler methods
   - Absent service integrations

2. **Data Flow Gaps**
   - Incomplete data synchronization
   - Missing validation rules
   - Broken integration points

3. **Business Logic Issues**
   - Incorrect workflow implementation
   - Missing approval mechanisms
   - Incomplete error handling

4. **User Experience Gaps**
   - Missing form validations
   - Incomplete feedback mechanisms
   - Poor error messaging

### Systematic Audit Process

#### Phase 1: Journey Decomposition
1. Parse the DrawIO XML file
2. Extract all shapes, connectors, and labels
3. Reconstruct the complete workflow
4. Document each process step with:
   - Input requirements
   - Processing logic
   - Output expectations
   - Error conditions

#### Phase 2: Code Mapping
1. For each journey step, identify corresponding:
   - Handler function
   - Service method
   - Data model
   - Validation rule
   - Integration point

2. Verify implementation completeness:
   - Function exists and is accessible
   - Logic matches journey requirements
   - Error handling is adequate
   - Data flow is correct

#### Phase 3: Gap Identification
1. Compare journey requirements with implementation
2. Identify missing components
3. Assess incomplete implementations
4. Evaluate integration gaps

#### Phase 4: Issue Ticket Creation
1. Generate detailed tickets for each gap
2. Prioritize based on business impact
3. Add technical implementation details
4. Define clear acceptance criteria

### Quality Assurance Criteria
