# Backend Developer Agent - Task 4: Implement Concurrency Control and Caching for ID Generation

## Core Objective
Enhance the `IdService.js` with improved concurrency handling, advanced ID caching mechanisms, and comprehensive quota monitoring to ensure reliable, high-performance ID generation in Google Apps Script environment.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Enhanced Concurrency Control
- **Increase Lock Timeouts**: Extend current lock timeout from default to 30 seconds for better handling of concurrent requests
- **Advanced Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff with circuit breaker pattern
- **Lock Optimization**: Add lock acquisition monitoring and fallback mechanisms
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Implement timeout-based lock release and recovery

### 2. Advanced ID Caching System
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Implement both in-memory and PropertiesService-based caching
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation logic based on time, usage patterns, and quota thresholds
- **Pre-generation Strategy**: Implement ID pre-generation during low-usage periods
- **Cache Warming**: Automatic cache population on service initialization

### 3. Comprehensive Quota Monitoring
- **Integration with QuotaMonitoringService**: Seamless integration for real-time quota tracking
- **Proactive Alerts**: Implement warning thresholds at 70%, 85%, and 95% quota usage
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Dynamic request throttling based on quota consumption
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed logging of ID generation patterns and quota utilization

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Service Enhancement

#### IdService.js Modifications
```javascript
// Enhanced lock configuration
const LOCK_CONFIG = {
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  retryAttempts: 5,
  backoffMultiplier: 1.5,
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 10
};

// Advanced caching configuration
const CACHE_CONFIG = {
  inMemorySize: 100,
  propertiesServiceTTL: 3600000, // 1 hour
  preGenerationBatchSize: 50,
  invalidationThreshold: 0.8
};

// Quota monitoring integration
const QUOTA_CONFIG = {
  warningThresholds: [0.7, 0.85, 0.95],
  throttlingEnabled: true,
  adaptiveThrottling: true
};
```

#### New Methods to Implement
1. **Enhanced Lock Management**
   - `acquireLockWithRetry(lockKey, options)`
   - `releaseLockSafely(lock)`
   - `handleLockTimeout(lockKey)`
   - `checkCircuitBreakerStatus()`

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - `initializeCache()`
   - `getCachedId(type, priority)`
   - `invalidateCache(strategy, criteria)`
   - `preGenerateIds(type, count)`
   - `warmCache()`

3. **Quota Integration**
   - `checkQuotaStatus()`
   - `recordQuotaUsage(operation, cost)`
   - `handleQuotaWarning(threshold)`
   - `adaptThrottling(quotaUsage)`

### Technical Specifications

#### Lock Enhancement
- Implement exponential backoff: `baseDelay * (backoffMultiplier ^ attemptNumber)`
- Circuit breaker pattern with failure threshold and recovery timeout
- Lock acquisition metrics and monitoring
- Graceful degradation when locks are unavailable

#### Caching Strategy
- **In-Memory Cache**: Fast access for frequently used IDs
- **PropertiesService Cache**: Persistent storage for longer-term caching
- **Cache Hierarchy**: Check in-memory first, then PropertiesService, finally generate new
- **Smart Invalidation**: Based on time, usage patterns, and quota consumption

#### Quota Monitoring
- Real-time quota tracking with `QuotaMonitoringService`
- Proactive warning system with configurable thresholds
- Adaptive throttling based on current quota usage
- Detailed analytics and reporting
