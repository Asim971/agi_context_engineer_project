## Context Integration Patterns

### Reference Integration
```markdown
**Standard Context Reference Pattern:**

All agent prompts must include:
- <mcfile name="mission.md" path=".agent-os/product/mission.md"></mcfile>
- <mcfile name="sales-eco-spec.md" path=".agent-os/projects/sales-eco-spec.md"></mcfile>
- <mcfile name="ai-guidelines.md" path=".agent-os/ai-guidelines.md"></mcfile>

**Context Validation:**
Before beginning any task, agents must confirm:
1. Understanding of business objectives and stakeholder requirements
2. Awareness of technical constraints and platform limitations
3. Alignment with quality standards and compliance requirements
4. Integration with existing system components and workflows
```

### Dynamic Context Injection
