# Utilities

This directory is intended to hold utility functions and helper scripts that can be used across the entire application. These are general-purpose functions that don't fit into a specific service or handler but provide necessary support for various tasks.

Currently, this directory is empty, but it can be populated with utilities for:

- Date and time formatting
- String manipulation
- Data validation helpers
- Other common, reusable logic
